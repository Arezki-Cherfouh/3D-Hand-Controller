Futuristic 3D Hand Controller

Description:
Futuristic 3D Hand Controller uses MediaPipe and OpenGL to track hand gestures via webcam, allowing real-time manipulation of 3D wireframe shapes. Zoom, rotate, move, and switch shapes or neon colors with intuitive gestures, creating an interactive and visually immersive experience.

Features:

Track one or two hands in real-time
Rotate 3D objects with an open hand
Move objects smoothly with a fist or two fingers closed
Zoom in and out by bringing hands together or apart
Switch between cube, sphere, torus, and pyramid shapes
Change neon colors for futuristic effects
On-screen UI shows current shape and zoom level

Controls:

SPACE: Change shape
C: Change color
Q or ESC: Quit

Requirements:

Python 3.8+
OpenCV
MediaPipe
PyOpenGL
Pygame
Numpy

How to Run:

1. Install dependencies via pip
2. Run `python main.py`
3. Use hand gestures to interact with the 3D object

Notes:

Ensure your webcam is connected
Two hands open controls zoom and rotation
One hand open rotates, fist moves the object
